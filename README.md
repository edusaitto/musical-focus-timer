![musical focus timer image](https://i.ibb.co/ng42CP5/Captura-de-Tela-2024-06-13-a-s-19-14-40.png)

the ideia of this simple project is to count how much time you stay focused, based on the time that you listen to some Spotify playlist.

## the tech

no backend needed at this point, but the frontend uses Next.JS with Tailwind CSS integrating directly with the Spotify API for auth and get the music.
